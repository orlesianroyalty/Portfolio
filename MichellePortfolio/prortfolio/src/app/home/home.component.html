          <p>Hello! I am a programmer and avid RPG fan.</p>
          <p>I graduated from Auburn University with a bachelor's degree in software engineering in 2019. I was a member of Auburn's video game development club, TigerDev, for 4 years and served as an officer for one. There I learned about different engines, game development concepts, and worked on various projects. There my love for games grew exponentially.</p>
          <p>I have a passion for video games, learning new technologies, and creating memorable experiences.</p>
