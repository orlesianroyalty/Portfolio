                <p>Hello! I am a programmer and avid RPG fan.</p>
                <p>I graduated from Auburn University with a bachelor's degree in software engineering in 2019. I was a member of Auburn's video game development club, TigerDev, for 4 years and served as an officer for one. There I learned about different engines, game development concepts, and worked on various projects. There my love for games grew exponentially.</p>
                <p>I have a passion for video games, learning new technologies, and creating memorable experiences.</p>

                        <p>I helped come up with the concept for Gaia. I was the project leader for this project after the initial game jam. I assigned tasks to my team members. I also hand drew some of the art used such as the flora and Gaia. I also wrote code for some of Gaia's abilities and wrote the code for Fenrir's AI statemachine for the boss battle.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-header">Overview</h2>
                    <p>Gaia is a 2D sidescrolling game in a 3D world. It was inspired by Paper Mario in that respect. The game was started as a game for a game jam about versatile verbs on a team of only two people but then expanded to a year long project with a larger team of students. </p>
                    <p>You play as Gaia who is searching for three different colored shards. These shards give Gaia different forms, Ranger, Desert Wanderer, and Arctic Bear. Each form gives Gaia unique abilities that combo with normal mechanics such as jumping to offer versatile combat abilities. Once all three shards are collected the boss, Fenrir, will spawn. Fenrir possess the ability to change into any of the three forms.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-header">Goal</h2>
                    <p>The goal for this project was to explore versatile verbs. This was acheived with the player's abilities since buttons would have to pressed for different lengths of time or combine different button presses to make it across platforms.</p>
